Hazard webmap project
Create a web map where people can find out about the estimated hazards' risks by providing their locations. 
By signing in as a member, the web apps will remember each account with their personal information (name, address and email address, 
household's information?)
Then the web app is expected to find at risk population and alert them (by sending email) in the event of any particular hazard
* Expect to do tsunami warning map (taking demorcratic info into account of evacuation's directions and time) --- however, 
in case of running out of time, a map showing all hazards could be a good idea too!
